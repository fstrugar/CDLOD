[CDLOD]

LeafQuadTreeNodeSize          = 8
#This determines how much granularity LOD will have: Reduce this to reduce
#size of the smallest LOD level quad; Increase to reduce number of batches
#and reduce memory usage.
#Restrictions: 
# - it must be power of two (2^n)
# - it must be bigger or equal to 2

RenderGridResolutionMult      = 1
#RenderGridResolution (resolution of mesh grid used to render terrain quads)
#will be  LeafQuadTreeNodeSize * RenderGridResolutionMult - use 1 for
#1-1 grid/texel ratio.
#Restrictions: 
# - it must be power of two (2^n)
# - LeafQuadTreeNodeSize * RenderGridResolutionMult must be <= 128

LODLevelCount                 = 5
# How many LOD levels to have - big heightmaps will require more LOD levels,
# and also the smaller the LeafQuadTreeNodeSize is, the more LOD levels will
# be needed.


[Rendering]

MinViewRange                     = 5000
# Minimum view range setting that can be set.
# View range defines range at which terrain will be visible. Setting ViewRange it
# to too low values will result in incorrect transition between LODs layers
# (warning message will be displayed on screen in that case) so that's why there's
# this minimum range specified here.
# If lower ranges than that are required, LODLevelCount must be reduced too.

MaxViewRange                     = 50000
# Maximum view range setting that can be set.
# Although there's no theoretical maximum, demo does not support too high values

LODLevelDistanceRatio         = 2.0
# Determines rendering LOD level distribution based on distance from the viewer.
# Value of 2.0 should result in equal number of triangles displayed on screen
# (in average) for all distances.
# Values above 2.0 will result in more triangles on more distant areas, and vice versa.
